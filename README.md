Landing page of fictional company (personal portfolio project)

This is a portfolio project consisting of a landing page for a fictional company (a restaurant). The site was build using the following technologies:
1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. SASS preprocesor (with SCSS syntax)
3. NPM (including autoprefixer, npm-run-all and postcss-cli for development and build setup)
4. Layout and components were build using CSS Grid and Flexbox
5. Keyframes for the animations (no jQuery was used in the project for greater challenge)
6. Media queries for ensuring responsiveness
7. Smooth-scroll library for smooth scrolling
8. Lazysizes library for deferred loading of images (for better performance)
9. Google maps API (reload the website if the map won't load for the first time)
